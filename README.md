# Special Thanks

This section is to provide a shoutout to the sites and training courses I took in order to complete this repo.

1. At the suggestion of one of the lead developers for a product at my current day job (as of April 2019) it was suggested I learn [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) & [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/). So I went to my handy dandy Udemy and purchased:  "[Robot Python](https://www.udemy.com/robot-python/)"

## Courses

- Udemy's "[Automated Software Testing With Python](https://www.udemy.com/automated-software-testing-with-python)"
