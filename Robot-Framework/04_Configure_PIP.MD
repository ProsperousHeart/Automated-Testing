In this document, we will learn how to configure PIP (Package Installation Manager).

**PIP** is the package installation manager for python. This allows you to download and install libraries.

However, this is not the only solution. You can also directly download and install libraries.

PIP? Will download **and** install for you.

1. Find Location

PIP already comes with python. You can locate the pip inside of `PYTHONLOCATION/Scripts` - and in this folder you will see bot **pip** and **Easy_install** as options.

Copy this location to be used in the next step.

2. Make Entry in Environment Variable

Navigate back to your **Environment Variables** and add this new location to your PATH.

You can test proper configuration by running `pip` on your command prompt. If it gives you a bunch of options, then it is configured successfully.
